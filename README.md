# Learn MCP

A hands-on learning project for Model Context Protocol (MCP) development, progressing from basic servers to advanced enterprise features.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol enables LLMs to securely access external data sources and tools, creating a standardized way for AI models to interact with various resources and services.

## Project Structure

```

├── phase3-integration/       # Practical: Real-world API integration
└── phase4-advanced/          # Enterprise: Advanced features and patterns
```

## Quick Start

1. **Choose your starting phase:** Begin with `phase1-basic-server/`
2. **Follow the learning plan:** Refer to `LEARNING_PLAN.md` for detailed guidance
3. **Test your servers:** Use MCP inspector to test your implementations
4. **Document your learnings:** Add notes and examples as you progress

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript
- Git

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone or navigate to this project
cd phase1-basic-server

# Install dependencies (when we add them)
npm install

# Run the server
npm start
```

## Learning Outcomes

- MCP server architecture and lifecycle
- Tool creation and management
- Resource and prompt handling
- API integration patterns
- Authentication and security
- Deployment and monitoring

## Resources

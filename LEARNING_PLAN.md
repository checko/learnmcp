# MCP Learning Plan

This project is designed to learn Model Context Protocol (MCP) through hands-on coding, progressing from basic concepts to advanced features.

## Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables LLMs to securely access external data sources and tools. This learning journey builds progressive MCP servers to understand the protocol's capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `phase1-basic-server/` - Basic MCP server with simple tools
- `phase2-resources-prompts/` - Resources and prompts management
- `phase3-integration/` - Real-world API integration
- `phase4-advanced/` - Advanced features and enterprise patterns

## Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Server Setup (Foundation)

**Location:** `phase1-basic-server/`

- Unit tests
- Documentation

### Phase 2: Resources & Prompts (Core Concepts)

**Location:** `phase2-resources-prompts/`

**Goals:**
- Master MCP resources and prompts
- Implement static and dynamic resources
- Create reusable prompts with parameters

**Topics Covered:**
- Static file resources
- Dynamic resource generation
- Prompt templates and parameters
- Resource subscriptions
- Context management

**Deliverables:**

### Phase 3: Real-World Integration (Practical Application)

**Location:** `phase3-integration/`

**Goals:**
- Integrate with external APIs
- Handle authentication and rate limiting
- Implement robust error handling

**Topics Covered:**
- REST API integration
- Authentication patterns
- Rate limiting and caching
- Error handling and recovery
- Data transformation

**Deliverables:**

- API key management system

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Enterprise Features)

**Location:** `phase4-advanced/`

**Goals:**
- Build production-ready MCP servers
- Implement security and monitoring
- Explore advanced transport mechanisms

**Topics Covered:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Custom transport protocols
- Logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Containerization and deployment

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-tenant MCP server
- Custom transport implementation
- Docker containerization
- Monitoring dashboard

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript
- Basic understanding of APIs
- Git

## Tools and Technologies

- **MCP SDK:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Testing:** Jest
- **Linting:** ESLint
- **Version Control:** Git

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:

1. **Understand MCP Architecture:** Server, client, and transport layers
2. **Build Production-Ready Servers:** From simple tools to complex integrations
3. **Handle Real-World Scenarios:** Authentication, error handling, performance
4. **Deploy and Monitor:** Containerization and observability
5. **Best Practices:** Security, testing, and maintainability

## Getting Started

1. Start with `phase1-basic-server/`
2. Each phase builds upon the previous
3. Test your servers with MCP inspector
4. Document your learnings in each phase

- [MCP SDK Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sdk)
- [MCP Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/examples)

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Phase 1: Basic Server âœ“
- [ ] Phase 2: Resources & Prompts
- [ ] Phase 3: Real-World Integration
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced Topics

## Notes

- Each phase is self-contained but builds knowledge progressively
- Focus on understanding concepts rather than rushing through phases
- Document challenges and solutions in each phase's README
- Experiment and modify examples to deepen understanding
